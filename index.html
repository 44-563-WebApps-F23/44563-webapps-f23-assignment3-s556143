    <h1>Varsha Pravallika Valavala</h1>
    <h6>Beach</h6>
    <p>The beach is where I like to vacation most.I adore listening to the sound of the <b>ocean lapping</b> at the shore, feeling the sand under my toes, and seeing a <b>stunning sunset</b> over the horizon.Being close to the ocean has a relaxing effect that helps me unwind and feel at peace with myself. There are lots of activities available, such as swimming in clean waters or making sandcastles with loved ones.</p>
